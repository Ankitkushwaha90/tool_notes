The message you're seeing indicates that Autopsy, a digital forensics tool, has started and is now running a web-based interface. You can access the Autopsy application using your web browser to begin analyzing digital evidence. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you use Autopsy:
How to Access and Use Autopsy:

    Verify the Autopsy Service is Running: Youâ€™ve successfully started Autopsy, and it is now running as a web application on your machine. The message shows that the service is running on localhost at port 9999.
        Evidence Locker location: /var/lib/autopsy
        Web Interface: Accessible at http://localhost:9999/autopsy

    Open Your Web Browser:
        Open your preferred web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
        In the address bar, type the following URL:

        http://localhost:9999/autopsy

    This will take you to the Autopsy web interface.

    Login to the Autopsy Interface:
        When you open the link in your browser, you should be prompted to log in to the Autopsy interface.
        If this is your first time using it, the default credentials are usually:
            Username: admin
            Password: password (or check the documentation if a different default is set)

    Create or Open a Case: Once logged in, you can either create a new case or open an existing one. Here's how:

        Creating a New Case:
            Click on the Create New Case option.
            Enter a Case Name, Case Number, and a brief Description for the case.
            Choose a location on your filesystem where the case will be saved (this is typically the Evidence Locker).
            After entering the required details, click Next to proceed.

        Opening an Existing Case:
            If you already have an existing case, you can click Open Existing Case and browse to the location of the case files.

    Add Evidence:
        Once the case is created or opened, you need to add evidence to analyze. You can add evidence files such as disk images, file systems, or other forensic evidence.
        Click on Add Evidence and select the type of evidence (e.g., Disk Image, File).
        Follow the prompts to upload the evidence you want to analyze (for example, an image file of a hard disk, or a specific file you're investigating).

    Start Analyzing the Evidence: After adding the evidence, Autopsy will process it, and you'll have access to various analysis tools such as:
        File Analysis: View and analyze files from the evidence.
        Keyword Search: Search for specific terms within the evidence.
        Timeline: View events in a timeline to see when files were created, modified, or accessed.
        Hash Analysis: Check for known hash values (e.g., MD5, SHA1, SHA256) to identify known files.
        Reports: Generate forensic reports based on your analysis.

    Generate Reports: After completing your analysis, you can generate a report summarizing your findings. This is useful for legal and investigative purposes.
        Navigate to the Reports section.
        Choose Generate Report.
        Select the report format (HTML, CSV, etc.).
        Click Generate to create the report.

Summary of Key Steps:

    Open your browser and go to http://localhost:9999/autopsy.
    Log in to the Autopsy web interface (default credentials might be admin/password).
    Create a new case or open an existing one.
    Add the forensic evidence you want to analyze (disk image, files, etc.).
    Start analyzing the evidence using the available tools.
    Generate forensic reports if needed.

Conclusion:

Autopsy provides a comprehensive web-based interface for digital forensics investigations. By following the above steps, you can upload and analyze evidence files, search for keywords, review file systems, and generate reports for further investigation. Make sure to keep the terminal with Autopsy running while you're working, as stopping it will stop the web interface.
